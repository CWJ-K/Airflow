# Goal
To build custom components in Airflow. It also helps me build an engineering mindset to understand the steps of constructing components based on an existing codebase. 

## Custom components to be built
  1. Hook
  2. Operator
  3. Sensor

Finally, custom components are distributed as a Python library.


# Initial Pilot Project
## Dataset: [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)
> index of datasets
## Structure

1. FlaskAPI to fetch data from MovieLens
